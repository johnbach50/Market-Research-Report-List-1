<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Miniature Resistance Thermometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-wire Configuration</li><li>Three-wire Configuration</li><li>Four-wire Configuration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Miniature Resistance Thermometer Market consists of three types: the Two-wire Configuration, Three-wire Configuration, and Four-wire Configuration. In the Two-wire Configuration, the thermometer is designed with only two wires, which makes it simple and cost-effective but prone to wire resistance errors. In the Three-wire Configuration, an additional wire is added to compensate for wire resistance errors, resulting in higher accuracy. The Four-wire Configuration further improves accuracy by using two pairs of wires, allowing for accurate measurement even with long cable lengths and high resistance values.</p></p>
