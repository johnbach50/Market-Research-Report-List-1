<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DC Electric Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brush DC Electric Motor</li><li>Brushless DC Electric Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DC electric motors are widely used in various industries and applications. There are two main types of DC electric motors: brush DC electric motors and brushless DC electric motors. Brush DC motors use brushes and a commutator to deliver power to the rotor, enabling the motor to rotate. These motors are cost-effective but require frequent maintenance. On the other hand, brushless DC motors do not have brushes and commutators, resulting in lower maintenance needs and higher efficiency. These motors are more expensive initially but offer better performance and durability in the long run.</p></p>
