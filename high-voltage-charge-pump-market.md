<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Voltage Charge Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Supply/Output</li><li>Mono Supply</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high voltage charge pump market comprises two main types: dual supply/output and mono supply. A dual supply/output charge pump operates by utilizing two different supply voltages and provides two separate output voltage levels. This allows for increased flexibility in power management applications. On the other hand, a mono supply charge pump employs a single supply voltage and generates a single output voltage level. This type is commonly used in applications where space and cost constraints are critical, but not as versatile as the dual supply/output type.</p></p>
