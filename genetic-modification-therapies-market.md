<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Genetic Modification Therapies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gene Therapies</li><li>Genetically Modified Cell Therapies</li><li>RNA Therapies</li><li>Gene Editing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Genetic modification therapies involve manipulating genes or genetic material to treat or cure diseases. Gene therapies aim to introduce healthy genes into a patient's cells to replace or compensate for faulty genes. Genetically modified cell therapies involve modifying a patient's own cells outside the body and then returning them to target and fight diseases. RNA therapies use small RNA molecules to interfere with or modify gene expression. Gene editing refers to techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 that can precisely modify genes, allowing for targeted changes to correct genetic defects or promote desired traits.</p></p>
