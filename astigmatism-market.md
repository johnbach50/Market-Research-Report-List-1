This results in distorted or blurred vision at any distance.</p><p>The global astigmatism market is anticipated to witness significant growth in the forecast period. Factors such as the increasing prevalence of astigmatism, rising geriatric population, and technological advancements in diagnostic and treatment options are driving market growth.</p><p>Moreover, the growing awareness regarding eye health and the availability of advanced corrective eyewear such as toric contact lenses and glasses are also contributing to the market growth. Additionally, the increasing adoption of refractive surgeries, such as LASIK (Laser-Assisted In-Situ Keratomileusis), to correct astigmatism is further boosting the market.</p><p>Furthermore, advancements in topography-guided LASIK technology and the development of innovative surgical techniques are expected to fuel the market growth. The rising disposable income and healthcare expenditure in developing countries are also likely to create lucrative opportunities for market players.</p><p>In conclusion, the astigmatism market is expected to experience a significant growth rate of 12.1% during the forecast period. Factors such as increasing prevalence, technological advancements, and a growing aging population contribute to this growth. The market is also driven by the availability of advanced corrective eyewear and the rising adoption of refractive surgeries. Ongoing advancements in surgical techniques and topography-guided LASIK technology are further expected to propel market growth.</p></p>
