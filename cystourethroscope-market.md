<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cystourethroscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid</li><li>Flexible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cystourethroscope market is classified into two main types: rigid and flexible. Rigid cystourethroscopes are rigid and inflexible, allowing for direct visualization of the bladder and urethra. They are commonly used for diagnostic purposes, such as examining the urinary tract for abnormalities. In contrast, flexible cystourethroscopes are more flexible and maneuverable, making them suitable for both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. They are able to navigate tight spaces and bend around curves, providing a less invasive option for patients. The choice between rigid and flexible cystourethroscopes depends on the specific procedure and patient requirements.</p></p>
