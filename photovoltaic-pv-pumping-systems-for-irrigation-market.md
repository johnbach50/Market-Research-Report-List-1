<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photovoltaic (PV) Pumping Systems for Irrigation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible</li><li>Surface Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photovoltaic (PV) pumping systems are used for irrigation purposes and are classified into two main market types: submersible pumps and surface pumps. Submersible pumps are installed underwater and are often more efficient due to the reduced distance they need to pump water. They are suitable for deep wells or boreholes. On the other hand, surface pumps are installed above the water source and are ideal for shallow wells or open water bodies. Both types utilize solar energy to power the pumps, making them sustainable and cost-effective options for irrigation.</p></p>
