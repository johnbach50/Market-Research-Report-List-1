<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar District Heating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solar Thermal Collectors</li><li>Thermal Energy Storage</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Solar District Heating (SDH) is a system that utilizes solar energy to provide heating and hot water for community buildings or residential areas. There are two main types of technologies used in SDH systems: solar thermal collectors and thermal energy storage. Solar thermal collectors capture sunlight and convert it into heat energy, which is then used to raise the temperature of water or other heat transfer fluids. Thermal energy storage involves storing excess heat generated during sunny periods for later use, ensuring a continuous and sustainable heat supply even during periods of low solar radiation.</p></p>
