<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Weir diaphragm valves</li><li>Straightway diaphragm valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diaphragm valves are typically classified into two main types - Weir diaphragm valves and Straightway diaphragm valves. Weir diaphragm valves have a raised weir or dam at the center of the valve body, which directs the flow of fluid through the valve. On the other hand, Straightway diaphragm valves have a straight-through flow path without any obstructions. Both types of diaphragm valves are commonly used in various industries for controlling the flow of fluids and maintaining a tight seal to prevent leakage.</p></p>
