<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pipeline Cleaning Robot Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure-based Cleaning Robot</li><li>Tool-based Cleaning Robot</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pressure-based cleaning robots use high-pressure water jets to clean pipelines, making them suitable for removing tough deposits like scale, rust, and debris. These robots are efficient for large pipelines and can cover long distances. On the other hand, tool-based cleaning robots use mechanical tools like brushes and scrapers to clean pipelines. They are ideal for removing soft deposits and are more versatile in terms of the types of pipelines they can clean. Both types of robots are essential for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of pipeline systems.</p></p>
