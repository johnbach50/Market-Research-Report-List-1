<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydro Turbine Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impulse Hydro Turbine Generator</li><li>Reaction Hydro Turbine Generator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydro turbine generators are used to convert the energy from moving water into electricity. There are two main types of hydro turbine generators: impulse and reaction. Impulse hydro turbine generators operate by directing a high-velocity stream of water onto the turbine blades, causing it to spin and generate electricity. On the other hand, reaction hydro turbine generators work by utilizing the pressure and flow of the water to rotate the turbine blades. Both types play a crucial role in harnessing hydropower and providing a sustainable source of electricity.</p></p>
