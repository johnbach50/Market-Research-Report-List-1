<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Probe Rocket Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One Stage Rocket</li><li>Multistage Rocket</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the market for probe rockets, there are two main types: one stage rockets and multistage rockets. One stage rockets are designed with a single propellant stage and are able to reach a certain altitude or speed before burning out. Multistage rockets, on the other hand, have multiple stages, with each stage burning out and separating as it is depleted. This allows multistage rockets to achieve higher altitudes and velocities compared to one stage rockets. Both types cater to different missions and requirements in the field of space exploration and research.</p></p>
