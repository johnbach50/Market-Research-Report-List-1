<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Soy Milk Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Mesh</li><li>Without Mesh</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic soy milk machines come in two market types: with mesh and without mesh. The "with mesh" machines use a mesh filter to separate the soy milk from the solid residues, resulting in a smoother and more refined texture. On the other hand, the "without mesh" machines rely on a different filtration method, such as centrifugal force, to separate the liquid from the solids. While these machines might produce soy milk with a slightly grittier texture, they offer easier cleaning and maintenance due to the absence of a mesh filter. Ultimately, the choice between the two types depends on individual preferences and priorities.</p></p>
