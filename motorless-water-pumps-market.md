<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Motorless Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Motorless water pumps are classified into two types: Positive-Displacement and Centrifugal. Positive-Displacement pumps use a mechanical method to displace or move the water, such as a piston or diaphragm. They are suitable for pumping thick or viscous liquids and can deliver a predetermined volume of water per cycle. On the other hand, Centrifugal pumps use centrifugal force to move the water, relying on the rotation of an impeller. They are ideal for pumping large volumes of water quickly and are commonly used in irrigation, water supply, and wastewater treatment applications.</p></p>
