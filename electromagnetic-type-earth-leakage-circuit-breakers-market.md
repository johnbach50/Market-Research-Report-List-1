<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electromagnetic-type Earth Leakage Circuit Breakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Voltage Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (VELCB)</li><li>Current Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (CELCB)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electromagnetic-type Earth Leakage Circuit Breakers are widely used to protect electrical systems from the risks of electric shock and fire caused by leakage currents. Two common types are Voltage Earth Leakage Circuit Breakers (VELCB) and Current Earth Leakage Circuit Breakers (CELCB). VELCBs detect and interrupt leakage currents by monitoring the voltage difference between the live and neutral conductors. On the other hand, CELCBs work by measuring the leakage current directly. Both types serve to disconnect the power supply when a certain leakage current threshold is exceeded, ensuring safety in electrical installations.</p></p>
