<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trunnion Block-Mounted Ball Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Bore</li><li>Reduced Bore</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Trunnion block-mounted ball valves can be categorized into two types: full bore and reduced bore. A full bore valve has a larger ball opening that allows the fluid to flow unobstructed through the valve, resulting in less pressure drop. On the other hand, a reduced bore valve has a smaller ball opening, which restricts the flow and creates higher pressure drop. Each type is suitable for different applications depending on the desired flow capacity and pressure requirements.</p></p>
