<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Maize Degerminators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Type</li><li>Vertical Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Maize degerminators are machines used to remove the germ from maize kernels. There are two main types of maize degerminators: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal degerminators have a horizontal structure with a rotating shaft that separates the germ from the kernels. On the other hand, vertical degerminators have a vertical structure with a shaft running vertically to achieve the same separation. Both types serve the purpose of removing the germ efficiently, but their structural orientation differs.</p></p>
