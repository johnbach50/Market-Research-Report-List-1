<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Scanning System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The contact type 3D scanning system involves physical interaction between the scanning device and the object being scanned. It captures measurements by physically touching the surface, making direct contact or using a probe. This type is suitable for capturing detailed information of small objects but may be time-consuming or damage delicate surfaces. On the other hand, non-contact type 3D scanning system utilizes sensors such as lasers or cameras to capture data without physical contact. It offers faster scanning speed, making it ideal for scanning larger or delicate objects without any potential damage.</p></p>
