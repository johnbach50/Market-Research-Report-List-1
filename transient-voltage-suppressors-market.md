<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transient Voltage Suppressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uni-polar TVS</li><li>Bi-polar TVS</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Transient Voltage Suppressors (TVS) are electronic devices used to protect sensitive components from voltage spikes and transients. Uni-polar TVS, also known as unidirectional TVS, are designed to suppress transients in one direction only, typically used in applications where polarity of the voltage is constant. On the other hand, bi-polar TVS, also known as bidirectional TVS, can suppress transients in both directions, making them suitable for applications with alternating polarities. Both types of TVS play a crucial role in preventing damage to electronic devices by diverting excessive voltage away from sensitive components, ensuring their safe operation.</p></p>
